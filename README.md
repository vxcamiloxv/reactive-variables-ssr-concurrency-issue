# Reactive variables concurrency issue

Reproducible repository with Next.js for Apollo client reactive variables concurrency
issue in SSR.

### Expected behavior
If in the render of a componente we set a reactive variable they
should keep the value only until the cache is clean or apollo instance
is begin destroyed on SSR or CSR

### Current behavior
The reactive variable keep the same value across request on SSR event
if the apollo client was stopped / destroyed or the cache was
cleaned/reset, it becomes a global variable in server.

## Quick Start

### Requirements 
- Node v14.x or higher

### Usage

```sh
$ yarn install
```

Run Next.js on dev mode
```sh
$ yarn dev
```

Open the main page and check the console (browser/terminal) or use Node inspect
[inspect](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/debugging)

```sh
$ yarn inspect
```

The relevant part happends inside `pages/_app.tsx`
